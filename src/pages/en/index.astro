  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>
    This site is my personal space — a crossroads of thought, creation and exploration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here you'll find:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>🧠 My background, CV, and interests</li>
    <li>🔍 Projects about synchronicities, AI, writing and more</li>
    <li>✍️ A blog of open reflection and free publishing</li>

    Everything presented in a clean space, ad-free, algorithm-free, designed for independence.
